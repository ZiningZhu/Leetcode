 - 004 Median of Two Sorted Arrays with O(log(n)) time  
 - 017 Letter Combination. Array traversal.
 - 020 How to recursively define validity of a parenthesis string and figure out a way to divide-and-conquer it easily?
 - 022 How to make a combo of bracket always balanced?

- Searching and Sorting  
 - 278 Remember how to implement Binary search  
 - 33 Binary search: Two pointers pointing to the {pos 0 and pos length}, then while (j>i+1); ans is in mid=i. There can be other ways to do so: {pos 0 and pos length-1}, then while (j>i); ans is in i==j==mid==ans. See revised solution.
